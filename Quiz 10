# Question 1

# a)
# No, it would be better off to have two separate CLASSES
# MUSIC can have multiple different GENRES,TONES,TEMPOS, ETC. and JAZZ can have multiple ARTIST,
# ALUBMS, and SONGS, that could all be possible SUBCLASSES

# b)
# Having ALBUM as the SUPERCLASS and SONG as a SUBCLASS would make the most sense.
# In an ALBUM there a number of different SONGS that go into the ALBUM.
# as for SONG the only thing I can think of are FEATURES, and SONG NAME.

# c)
# It would be better to have CLASS B as a SUPERCLASS and CLASS A as a SUBCLASS
# since they have the same attributes that have the same METHODS its better to have it all under one CLASS

# Question 2

# a)

# Question 3

    except Exception as error:
        print('only integers and floats are allowed for the price and calories')
